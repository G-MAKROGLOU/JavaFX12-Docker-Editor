# JavaFX12-Docker-Editor
Docker Editor built with JavaFX12 and ace.js on Maven 3.6.0  

Extracted from a bigger application. All source code will be available ready for integration. More components of that application
will be uploaded soon so you can choose a component or the whole app. This is a single person made application so keep in mind that
minor fixes in some components might be needed. (E.g DBMS Supports only very basic types for now [CHAR, VARCHAR, INT, FLOAT, BLOB,
etc.]) Some components might need additional libraries and/or api keys to run.

2)ace.js (javascript base for editor used by Atom and VSCode with color highlighting depending the language)

3)jfxtras
