# JavaFX12-Docker-Editor
Docker Editor built with JavaFX12 and ace.js on Maven 3.6.0  

Extracted from a bigger application. All source code will be available ready for integration. More components of that application
will be uploaded soon so you can choose a component or the whole app. This is a single person made application so keep in mind that
minor fixes in some components might be needed. (E.g DBMS Supports only very basic types for now [CHAR, VARCHAR, INT, FLOAT, BLOB,
etc.])

Upcoming JavaFX12 and Maven 6.3.0 Components:

1)Docker Editor (ace.js)

2)MySQL DBMS (Database Management System)

3)Calendar - Agenta

4)Password safe

5)PII safe

6)Credit card safe

7)Calculator

8)Frequently Typed Commands Terminal

9)A mini library with 93 pre-made alert classes and the parent Interface

10)IP Scanner
